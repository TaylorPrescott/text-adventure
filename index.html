Can you escape the room?<br><br>&emsp;You awake in an umfamiliar room. The last thing you can remember is walking to your car last night after dinner. You had gone to meet up with some friends to celebrate your new promotion at work. Your mind starts racing as you frantically beat on the door. Is this some sort of prank? Surely not, that doesn’t make much sense. As you calm yourself down, you remember a couple of strange letters that recently arrived in your mailbox. The author of the letters wrote that he has been a big fan of yours for some time now, and is dying to meet you. While unsettling, you figured it was some neighborhood kids pulling a prank since you don’t have any fans. You simply go to work and use your free time on hobby projects that interest you. Nothing that a stranger would know about or be writing you letters about. Both of the letters were signed, ‘Your secret admirer’. You realize that this isn’t the time to try and figure things out. It’s time to get out of this room.
